# Alfheim Kotlin UI API (KUI)
This project is an api from [Alfheim Mc](https://gitlab.com/alfheim-mc), a modded minecraft server.
# Introduction
In this section, you will learn about what is this api and the reasons why we
created it.
## Overview
This API aims to provide a new way to create **UI components** on the game
Minecraft. Using *Kotlin DSL* to make it even shorter than **HTML code**,
this API allows creating **GUIS** and other **HUD** elements.

# Todo
## Scenes
Implement alerts.
## Text area
Texts that can be modified by the player's inputs.
## Scrollable
Containers that can be scrollable if their content exceeds the dimensions.
## Value Watchers
Add watchers for modified values
